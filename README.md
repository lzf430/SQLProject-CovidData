COVID Cases Analysis - README

1. Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 data from the PortfolioProject database, focusing on Malaysia in 2023. The analysis includes examining total cases, deaths, population percentages, vaccination rates, and running totals of new vaccinations.


2. SQL Queries

The project involves several SQL queries to extract and analyze relevant data:


3. Total Cases and Deaths:

Calculates total cases, deaths, and percentage of deaths among infected individuals in Malaysia.


4. Population Infection Rate:

Calculates the percentage of Malaysia's population infected by COVID-19.


5. Highest COVID Percentage Day:

Identifies the day in Malaysia with the highest percentage of the population infected by COVID-19.


6. Global and Country-specific Analysis:

  -Analyzes global new cases, total deaths, and new deaths compared to new cases by date.

  -Identifies countries with the highest infection rates and death counts per population.


7. COVID Vaccination:

  -Examines total population versus vaccinations in Malaysia.

  -Calculates the running total of new vaccinations and their percentage relative to the population.


8. Visualization

  -Data can be visualized using tools like Tableau Public for clearer insights into trends, peaks, and vaccination progress over time.


9. Usage

  -Ensure connection to the PortfolioProject database with appropriate permissions.

  -Run SQL queries sequentially or as needed to extract specific data points.

  -Use the results for further statistical analysis or visualization.


10. Future Enhancements

  -Expand analysis to include other countries or regions.

  -Incorporate additional datasets for a more comprehensive view of COVID-19 impacts.

  -Implement automated updates for real-time analysis if applicable.
